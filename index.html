        <h1>Top GDPR Questions You Must Practice for Certprep Success</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Preparing for a GDPR exam can feel heavy at first. The rules look strict. The terms look long. The rights and principles feel endless. But there is a simple truth. When you pick the right GDPR questions and follow a steady certprep routine, the whole process becomes easier. You study with a calm mind. You learn with more clarity. This guide walks you through the areas that matter most, so you can practice with purpose and feel ready for your test.</p>
        <p>Below, you will see the core topics, clear points, and simple practice questions. Everything is explained in plain language so you can study without stress.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Why Practicing GDPR Questions Matters</h2>
        <p>Many learners begin by trying to memorize every definition. This feels safe, but the exam works in a different way. It checks how you think. It looks at how you apply each rule in real situations. It tests how fast you can link the right principle to the right action.</p>
        <p>Strong certprep starts with questions. Practicing <b><a href="http://certprep.io/pecb/gdpr/questions"> GDPR questions</a></b> builds your logic. It helps you learn the pattern behind the law.</p>

        <h3>How Questions Build Confidence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They guide you toward what examiners look for.</li>
            <li>They highlight weak areas so you can focus better.</li>
            <li>They help ideas stay in your memory.</li>
            <li>They train your mind to respond in a compliance mindset.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Expect in a GDPR Exam</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Scenario based questions</li>
            <li>True or false style items</li>
            <li>Multiple choice formats</li>
            <li>Case study problems that test reasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Top GDPR Questions You Must Practice</h2>
        <p>This section covers the main exam areas. You can use these topics as your roadmap. Read each part slowly. Think through the logic. Then answer the practice questions so your mind becomes used to the structure of the exam.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h3>1. GDPR Principles</h3>
        <p>These principles sit at the base of everything. When you know them well, the rest feels lighter and easier.</p>

        <h4>Key Principles to Study</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Lawfulness</li>
            <li>Fairness</li>
            <li>Transparency</li>
            <li>Purpose limitation</li>
            <li>Data minimization</li>
            <li>Accuracy</li>
            <li>Storage limitation</li>
            <li>Integrity and confidentiality</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="practice-box">
            <h4>Practice Questions</h4>
            <p><strong>Q1:</strong> What is the purpose of the data minimization principle?</p>
            <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Why does storage limitation matter for compliance?</p>
            <p><strong>Q3:</strong> Which principle focuses on keeping personal data accurate and updated?</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Lawful Bases for Processing</h3>
        <p>Every action that involves personal data needs a legal base. This is one of the most common topics in the exam.</p>

        <h4>What You Must Learn</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Consent</li>
            <li>Contract</li>
            <li>Legal obligation</li>
            <li>Vital interests</li>
            <li>Public task</li>
            <li>Legitimate interests</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="practice-box">
            <h4>Practice Questions</h4>
            <p><strong>Q4:</strong> When is consent considered valid under GDPR?</p>
            <p><strong>Q5:</strong> What is the difference between contractual necessity and legitimate interest?</p>
            <p><strong>Q6:</strong> Can legitimate interest apply to marketing activities?</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. Data Subject Rights</h3>
        <p>This area appears in almost every exam. You must know each right, its purpose, and its response time.</p>

        <h4>Important Rights</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Right of access</li>
            <li>Right to rectification</li>
            <li>Right to erasure</li>
            <li>Right to restriction</li>
            <li>Right to portability</li>
            <li>Right to object</li>
            <li>Right regarding automated decision making</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="practice-box">
            <h4>Practice Questions</h4>
            <p><strong>Q7:</strong> How long does a controller get to respond to a right of access request?</p>
            <p><strong>Q8:</strong> When can a person ask for their data to be deleted?</p>
            <p><strong>Q9:</strong> What is the main function of the right to data portability?</p>
        </div>

        <h3>4. Data Controllers and Data Processors</h3>
        <p>Mixing these roles is a common exam mistake. The exam checks if you can separate duties clearly.</p>

        <h4>What to Study</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Duties of a controller</li>
            <li>Duties of a processor</li>
            <li>Data Processing Agreements</li>
            <li>Joint controllers</li>
            <li>Sub processors</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="practice-box">
            <h4>Practice Questions</h4>
            <p><strong>Q10:</strong> What must a Data Processing Agreement include?</p>
            <p><strong>Q11:</strong> Who is responsible for showing proof of compliance?</p>
            <p><strong>Q12:</strong> Can a processor hire a sub processor without approval?</p>
        </div>

        <h3>5. Data Breaches and Notifications</h3>
        <p>A data breach is a serious event. GDPR explains what to report, when to report it, and who to notify.</p>

        <h4>Key Points</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>What counts as a breach</li>
            <li>Notification timelines</li>
            <li>Reporting to authorities</li>
            <li>Informing individuals</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="practice-box">
            <h4>Practice Questions</h4>
            <p><strong>Q13:</strong> What is the 72 hour reporting rule in GDPR?</p>
            <p><strong>Q14:</strong> When should affected individuals be notified?</p>
            <p><strong>Q15:</strong> Who decides if a breach creates high risk?</p>
        </div>

        <h3>6. DPIAs</h3>
        <p>A Data Protection Impact Assessment helps manage risk before damage occurs. You must know the situations where this step becomes required.</p>

        <h4>What to Learn</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>High risk processing</li>
            <li>Evaluation points</li>
            <li>Documentation requirements</li>
            <li>Consultation with authorities when needed</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="practice-box">
            <h4>Practice Questions</h4>
            <p><strong>Q16:</strong> When is a DPIA compulsory?</p>
            <p><strong>Q17:</strong> What happens when a DPIA shows high risk that cannot be lowered?</p>
            <p><strong>Q18:</strong> Who is responsible for creating the DPIA?</p>
        </div>

        <h3>7. International Data Transfers</h3>
        <p>This topic appears often due to ongoing updates in global transfer rules.</p>

        <h4>Important Transfer Tools</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Adequacy decisions</li>
            <li>Standard Contractual Clauses</li>
            <li>Binding Corporate Rules</li>
            <li>Supplementary measures</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="practice-box">
            <h4>Practice Questions</h4>
            <p><strong>Q19:</strong> What is an adequacy decision?</p>
            <p><strong>Q20:</strong> Why are Standard Contractual Clauses used?</p>
            <p><strong>Q21:</strong> When do supplementary measures become required?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>
